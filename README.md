# Chef Fundamentals Lab - Day 3
Hands-on exercises for Chef Fundamentals training

## Purpose

This repo is designed to accompany the hands-on Chef Fundamentals training course. The Day 2 exercises are dedicated to working with community cookbooks and other Chef Server artifacts, like Roles, Environments, and Data Bags.

## Lab Environment

These exercises should be completed on a learner's local workstation, where the Chef Workstation or ChefDK has been installed.

Your instructor will provide you with login information for the Windows and Centos instances to be configured. The cookbook code itself is _not_ intended to be executed on a learner's local machine. Do not run the chef-client on your local workstation.

## Resources

The training references the [Chef Documentation](https://docs.chef.io) to encourage learners to look up information and become self-sufficient in troubleshooting. If the documentation cannot be accessed behind your firewall, you can alternatively access the [chef-web-docs](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs) GitHub page, or the older [Chef12 DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/chef~12/) pages for reference. If none of these are accessible, please make this known to your instructor.

Let's cook up a storm!
